\section{Abstract}
This is the report for the main project in the course TDT4195. The assignment was to graphically represent a image with different coloured circular objects using computer-graphics and image-processing techniques. The task was solved in to parts, one image-processing part using Matlab, and one computer-graphics part using OpenGL. The Matlab-script writes a .txt file with coordinates, radius and color of the objects found. The OpenGL program then reads that file and represents the content as different coloured cubes in a three dimensional coordinate system. The programs are further explained in the sections below.
