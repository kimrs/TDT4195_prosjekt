\section{OpenGL}
The program created in this part of the assignment, is made by modifying code given to us for the graphics part of the course. Color-buffers and a vertex-buffer is first created. For each frame, RenderScene is called. The text-file is then read using ReadFile.cpp. ReadFile uses the windows library conio.h to read the file. This causes the program to not support other operating systems. It returns a pointer to the first parameter used to represent a cube. Each cube requires four parameters to be represented. One for color, one for radius, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate. After setting the values, a model-matrixfor the cube is made. The model-matrix consists of an identity-matrix multiplyes with a translation-matrix, multiplyed with a scale-matrix. The model-matrix for the cube represents the radius and position of the object. After multiplying the model-matrix with the mvp-matrix, a collor-buffer is bound before drawing the cube. The process is repeated until all objects are represented. 


\subsection{Improvements}
Today, the cubes are given color by static premade color-buffers. To support all colors, one buffer for each different color given in the input-file should be made. This solution was considered, but because of memoryleaks in the program, the values from the file where overwritten. Lack of experience programming in the C-language, caused us to accept our program not being able to support more colors.
